## What (pause) is (pause) a ‘T-shaped’ learner?

A ‘T-shaped’ learner is someone who combines depth in their subject with a broad understanding of other disciplines.

## How does (pause) the ‘T-shaped’ learner concept apply to a creative writing student?

The ‘T-shaped’ learner concept is quite possibly most important to creative writers, as what we do can only be done by accessing non-linear aspects of our own experiences. To put is simply, it is hard to write a novel set in the old west without knowing the history of the old west very well.

A good vertical component of the ‘T-shaped’ learner for creative writers is a specific genera. Personally, I chose parody, because of my cynical nature, my belief that no one is 100% correct about anything, and my inability to believe in fanaticism.

A good horizontal component of the ‘T-shaped’ learner for creative writers is anything at all that catches your interest. You see, in order to become a good writer, you need experience living in the world, or, at least, a world (for fantasy writers), and the horizontal component of the ‘T-shaped’ learner for creative writers lends itself to learning a good verisimilitude that you can use in your works.


## So how can you become ‘T-shaped’ too?

Well, if you have been to Virginia Tech in the past year and a half, you are already one! (music pauses in shock before continuing) Taking a look at the curriculums for many of the programs here at VT, I can see a great deal of vaguely-related to completely unrelated topics that are required for a degree. Let’s take computer science for example. (music pauses, sound of shuffling paper(self made)) Let’s see here… (more shuffling paper) Ah! Here it is. Yes… yes… See, right here, CHEM 1035 and 1045, General Chemistry and Lab; and here in the fourth semester, COMM 2004, Public Speaking.

(Music resumes) Isn’t that great? In order to get a degree in programming computer code, you need to get at least a C in two completely unrelated topics! Isn’t being a ‘T-shaped’ learner awesome?
